# Pokemon-SwSh-Seed-Generator
Generate perfect den seeds for raid seed injection.

This minimal user-unfriendly project will let you parallel search trillions of frames for the perfect raid seed.

To use: Modify main in Main.cpp. Then compile and run.
The program will automatically print out any matching seeds that it finds as well as how many skips away from the starting seed.
